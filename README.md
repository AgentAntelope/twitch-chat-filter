twitch-chat-filter
==================

Twitch chat filter; primarily for TwitchPlaysPokemon

Initially seeded from this thread, which seemed like the most recent version: http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/1y8ukl/chat_filter_script_updated_for_democracy

If no one likes that one (didn't have a lot of upvotes, but I didn't see others dealing with "Democracy Mode"), feel free to copy-paste over it to a different version that's more widespread.
