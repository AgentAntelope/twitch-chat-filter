Twitch.TV Chat Filter
==================

TODOs
-----------
- Update the script to work both in the popout chat and in the normal chat
- Find a way to filter out most misspellings of the commands

Update the compressed (minified) version whenever you make a substantive update.  No need for small things like formatting or comments, obviously.

Initially seeded from this thread, which seemed like the most recent version: http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/1y8ukl/chat_filter_script_updated_for_democracy.
