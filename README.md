Twitch.TV Chat Filter
==================

Update the compressed (minified) version whenever you make a substantive update.  No need for small things like formatting or comments, obviously.

TODOs
-----------
- Update the script to work both in the popout chat and in the normal chat
- Test and tweak the algorithm which identifies misspellings
- Replace `setInterval()` implementation, per Issue #11
- Have consistent formatting across the entire .js file (variables and function names should either be in `camelCase` or have their names `separated_with_underscores`, but not a haphazard amalgamation of the two)
